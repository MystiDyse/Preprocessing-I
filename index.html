      <h1>Listen Up...</h1>
        <p>I am currently a Lambda School Student. Prior to that I have been a Manager for Ralphs Grocers for 5 years and on special assignment developing High Performance Teams across the district. Rewarded for my Customer Service skills and ability to connect with my peers and customers alike. I have always given 120% in my work and obsess over getting it done and done right. I have worked several jobs and in each of them my ability to train others has shown my Superiors and myself that I have truly mastered the position. I plan to do the same at Lambda School.</p>
